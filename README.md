# SwiftTipCalculator
Swift - Swift Tip Calculator - Demo 3 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code the swift Tip Calculator.

When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted with the title on top 'Tip Calculator'. Then 
right below is a text field where the user puts in the amount to generate the tip. Followed right below is a Segmented Control
that is programed with 4 values to use for a tip amount. Those values are 10%, 15%, 18% and 20%. Then right below that control
is a Slider (default 50%) which can also go from 0% to 100% for a tip amount. As we go down there are two labels calling out 
the calculated 'Tip Amount' and the 'Total Amount' that is automatically calculated from either the Segmented Control or 
Slider Selections. The dollar amounts at the top are inputed in via pop up keypad. Its an interesting and simple app to use on 
your iOS device.
